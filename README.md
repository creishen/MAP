## Core System Features

### 1. Statutory Visual Vessel Inspection
- **Split-Screen Inspection Workspace**: High-density split-screen interface displaying statutory checklist items alongside inspection result selection and corrective action tracking.
- **Categorized Evidence Attachments**: Item-level evidence attachment system supporting photo and document file uploads with thumbnail previews (52x52px visual previews, file sizes, and metadata).
- **Inline Finding Comments**: Immediate observation and deficiency note recording per checklist item.
- **Direct CAPA Generation**: Ability to raise Corrective Action Preventive Action (CAPA) items directly from checklist findings with assigned owners and due dates.
- **Smart Outcome Recommendation**: Automated outcome suggestions (`Pass`, `Pass with observations`, `Fail`) based on checklist item ratings.

### 2. Multi-Persona Workspaces & Governance
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Dedicated views tailored for four core maritime personas:
  - **Inspector**: Conducts physical vessel surveys, records findings, uploads evidence, and submits survey outcomes.
  - **Verifier**: Audits uploaded certificates, verifies statutory document validity, and checks compliance records.
  - **Approver**: Reviews inspection findings, approves/rejects vessel assurance requirements, and manages risk releases.
  - **Administrator**: Oversees fleet registries, configures assurance rules, and monitors system-wide audit logs.
- **User Authentication**: Secure multi-role login interface with role switching and profile management.

### 3. Audit Trail & Compliance Verification
- **Immutable Log Tracking**: Every inspection action, outcome submission, evidence upload, and CAPA creation is logged with timestamps, user IDs, roles, organizations, and justification notes.
- **Filtering & Export**: Searchable audit trail table filtered by asset name, date range, user role, and event severity.

### 4. Responsive Enterprise Design
- **Full-Height Connected Layout**: 100vh full-height left navigation sidebar seamlessly joined with top header navigation banner.
- **Maritime Primary Color Palette**: Styled using deep navy primary (`rgb(11, 27, 43)`), slate accents, clean typography (IBM Plex Sans & Arial), and responsive breakpoints across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
